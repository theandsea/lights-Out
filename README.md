lightsoff game developed by React.

There are 3 ways to run the game:
1--open https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/oWWQNa; then copy the src files (index.js, index.html, index.css) to the corresponding part. </p>
2--already built file is in build folder. download it and open the index.html directly. </p>
3--download the official react platform(npx create-reat-app my-app), then copy the src files and replace the corresponding src files in /src. </p>
